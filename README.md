#### What is veganism?
According to the vegan society, 

>Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

Veganism is not just a diet. It is a way of life that seeks to eschew all animal exploitation. This also includes avoiding clothing, accessories, make-up, any other products that rely on animals or animal testing, and avoiding forms of entertainment, such as zoos or aquariums, that inherently exploit animals.

#### What about vegetarianism? Dairy and eggs don't rely on killing animals, right?
Unfortunately, the dairy and egg industry are no less cruel and callous than their meat counterparts. In fact, one might argue that the dairy and beef industry are just two sides of the same coin, as are the egg and chicken industries. 

Like all mammals, cows produce milk to feed their young, so milk production is stimulated by pregnancy and birth. In order to create milk, female cows are forcefully inseminated. Like many other creatures, cows want to bond with their young. Unfortunately, when they give birth, their calf is torn away from them. If it's a female, it will likely become another dairy cow. If it's a male, it will be killed or sold for veal. Then the mother is made pregnant again. This cycle continues until her body is "used up" and no longer profitable, at which point she will be killed for beef as well.

Likewise, male chickens have little "value" in the egg industry. They aren't large enough to be used as "boilers" (chickens killed for their meat) and they don't produce eggs. As a result, the egg industry resorts to culling of male chicks (usually chickens that are less than a day old) by throwing them in a large macerator (basically a big blender) or gas chamber.

#### Isn't vegetarianism better than nothing?
In some ways, yes. Vegetarianism generally results in less animal death than the typical Western diet. However, as mentioned above, it still generally involves supporting the egg and dairy industries, which still inflict unimaginable amounts of animal suffering.

#### I work out a lot. How do I get enough calories/protein?
Most people overestimate how much protein they actually need. I recommend reading [this article by No Meat Athlete](https://www.nomeatathlete.com/protein-for-athletes/). In short, whether you're an athlete or not, it's fairly easy to get enough protein (and calories) on a vegan diet. If [Patrik Baboumian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Baboumian) can do it, so can you :)

#### Won't I become B12 deficient? 
Many people are not aware that Vitamin B12 actually originates from microbes in soil, and is not a natural component of animal flesh or secretions. Since we clean our produce so thoroughly, we don't consume soil that might contain B12. When animals were naturally grazing, they would consume plants (and soil), the B12 would accumulate in their bodies, and then it would get passed on to anyone who consumes them. However, the vast majority of livestock animals in animal farming are not left to naturally graze and live on feedlots, consuming grains like soy and corn. As a result, these animals now receive mass B12 supplementation. Why not skip the middleman? B12 supplementation is a perfect way to get your daily B12 requirement. While you can certainly swallow a normal B12 pill or take B12 sublingual lozenges, the most convenient way is probably [using B12 toothpaste](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-b12-fortified-toothpaste/).

#### If everyone stops eating meat and dairy, won't farmers lose jobs?
That's definitely a possibility; however, this kind of transition won't happen overnight. Less demand for meat and dairy will mean more demand for plant-based alternatives, which means meat and dairy farmers will have more opportunity to transition to farming crops that contribute to the supply chains for those products. Some plant-based food producers are even doing what they can to help with this transition, such as Miyoko's Creamery, who has [partnered with Farm Sanctuary](https://www.fastcompany.com/90737927/this-plant-based-company-wants-to-help-dairy-farmers-pivot-from-cows-to-crops) to help transition dairy farmers to farming plants. Milk consumption [continutes to decline](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/milk-consumption-dairy-farmers/) while [demand for plant-based milk grows](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/plant-milk-market). One could make that argument that moving to other industries is simply a shrewd business decision at this point.

#### Isn't it expensive to be vegan?
No, but that also depends on your tastes and preferences. Plant-based meat and dairy replacements are not generally regarded as cheap. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. Many plant-based products are sold by companies that are also [meat producers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lightlifefoods-m-a-maple-leaf-foods-idUSKBN1602M5), or engage in other [unethical business practices](https://www.foodbev.com/news/nestle-usa-agrees-deal-for-meat-alternatives-brand-sweet-earth/), so care needs to be taken when purchasing these products if your goal is to avoid supporting such companies. Many plant-based products are created/acquired by these companies with no ethical compass and only profit as their goal. While I would argue they're still more healthy than their meat and dairy counterparts, they're are also often heavily processed, so they should probably be seen as a luxury. That being said, even if you eat these products every week, you might be surprised by their cost [when compared to traditional meat and dairy products](https://www.moneyunder30.com/true-cost-of-going-vegan). 

In general, healthy whole foods, such as fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and whole grains, are very affordable. By eating simple, healthy foods, you can easily keep your vegan food budget to [$200-250/month/person](https://www.iamgoingvegan.com/cost-of-being-vegan/).

#### This is the fault of factory farms. We should be holding companies accountable instead of blaming individuals.
That is true, but that kind of black-and-white thinking isn't productive -- we can do both. In our capitalist system, buying a product is akin to voting with your dollar. The current system doesn't inherently reward ethical practices. I'd encourage you to vote for politicians who care about animal equality and incentivizing ethical business practices so we can change the system. In the meantime, the best way to influence change is to stop purchasing these products. 

#### Doesn't plant agriculture kill animals still?
Mass plant farming/harvesting does result in the death of some animals. However, that number still [pales in comparison](https://animalvisuals.org/projects/1mc/) to the number of animals killed for the production of animal products. This also ignores the fact that, as stated above, most farm animals live on feedlots and are fed grains (as a side note, this might be a contributor to [more food-borne illness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9733511/)). INSERT FACT ABOUT ANIMAL CALORY EFFICIENCY.

#### Isn't going vegan hard?
No! This depends on your perspective though. Many vegans are motivated by the horrors they've learned about when researching what happens on industrial farms. Knowing the suffering and pain that the animals endure is usually enough motivation. 

Speaking personally, there are more than enough plant-based alternatives now to satisfy my own cravings for tasty food. The hardest part about being vegan is not abstaining from animal products. It's having to live in a world where animal suffering is normalized by society at large -- a world where you're constantly faced with the knowledge of this suffering, and most of the people you interact with regularly not only go along with it, but may be actively hostile towards you for not doing so yourself. This is the true reason [vegans are at higher risk for depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32483598/) and all vegans know this.

#### I heard soy gives you man-boobs
This is a myth. Soy contains compounds called [phytoestrogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogen#Effects_on_humans), also known as "dietary estrogen" or "plant estrogen." There is currently [no strong evidence](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/phytoestrogens-and-men#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3) that phytoestrogens affect humans adversely. On the contrary, there is [evidence](https://nutritionfacts.org/2019/11/21/how-phytoestrogens-can-have-anti-estrogenic-effects/) that a certain amount of soy is beneficial to human health.

[Dairy, on the other hand, contains _actual_ estrogen, along with many other hormones, including progesterone, testosterone, prolactin, and insulin-like growth factor-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524299/). Human milk also contains such hormones. This makes sense when you think about it. Cows milk is meant for baby cows, who may need access to these hormones for proper development, much like human milk for baby humans. Why would adult human beings need to consume another animal's secretions for proper sustenance? Consider that [65% of the world's population is lactose intolerant](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/lactose-intolerance-by-country).

Consuming dairy products as an adult human being, along with the naturally occurring hormones they contain, could have serious health implications. Some examples:

* [Dairy consumption as a contributing factor to acne](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847434/)

#### Isn't eating meat natural?
Perhaps, but does _natural_ equate to _ethical_ from a human's perspective? And does _natural_ always equate to _healthy_, or _nutritionally necessary_?

We could discuss the likely diets of early humans. Just as we make the argument that it's natural for baby cows to consume cows' milk, we could argue that because early humans killed a certain amount of animals and ate a certain amount of meat, that it's natural for us to do so.

However, this argument is mostly irrelevant in our current age. In the wake of technology, a large human population, and the resulting economic scale, we've scaled meat production to levels that treat animals as mere commodities. There is simply nothing _natural_ about the current way animals are bred, raised, and killed for our consumption. The processes of going to the grocery store and purchasing packaged meat or ordering a burger at a restaurant have no resemblance to the process of an ancient human hunter killing and consuming an animal for sustenance.

On the other hand, in the wake of new technology, eating meat simply isn't necessary, regardless of whether or not it's natural. We now have perfectly healthy plant-based alternatives.

#### What about lab-grown meat?
Lab-grown meat is an interesting prospect, and some say they'll wait for it's general availability before they stop consuming traditional meat. Who knows when that will happen though -- or if it will ever happen. In either case, lab grown meat still relies on an animal to be produced. They need a small amount of animal cells to grow the meat. Right now they're growing meat in small quantities, so it's easy for them to show the animals they get the cells from as happy cows or chickens grazing. They apply some mild anesthetic and gently scrape some cells off a cow or whatever. However, as we've seen, any product that uses some part of an animal (or their secretions) as an input to production will ultimately become unethical when scaled up. My pessimistic side can envision a future where animals are kept in cages their whole life and their cells are scraped off all day until they die.

#### This post makes me angry
I understand. Vegans make a lot of people angry. In some cases, they think that vegans have a superiority complex. While that may be true in some cases, I'd like to think that's not the case for me, and it's not the case for most vegans. I also understand some people feel that vegans are "pushing" their lifestyle or opinions on them and that what they eat is a "personal choice." While I agree, peoples' diet and lifestyle involves a lot of personal choices, I would ask this: should a choice that has a victim be considered a personal choice? If one path is sure to inflict suffering and death, and another minimizes it, can it be personal? A personal decision is one that only impacts the person making it.
